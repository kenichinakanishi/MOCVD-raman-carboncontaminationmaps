# MOCVD-Carbon-Contamination-Raman-Maps

Python processing of Raman data from a Rernishaw inVia Raman Microscope.

Used to extract and plot both single scans and map scans.

Scans were used to analyse the coverage of WS2 films after an MOCVD process with different doses of DMS. 


Lorentz curves fitted to each peak to extract information on position and amplitude.

This is used to plot 2D heatmaps of selected peak intensities.
